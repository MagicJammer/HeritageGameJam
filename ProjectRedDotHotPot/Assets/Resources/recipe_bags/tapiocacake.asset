  StoryData:
  - StoryLine: "My great grandma once told me a story about the time during the Japanese
      occupation and how they had to survive on tapioca. So she made a dessert out
      of it as well. It\u2019s a bite-sized dessert, consisting of steamed tapioca,
      a starch made from cassava root, which is then coated with grated coconut.
      \r\nIt was the small bit of joy she could get during those times. \r\n"
